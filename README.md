GQ Backend Developer Assessment 
 
Create a webpage that shows memes using REST API along with the details of cookies stored during the session 
 
1. Login page accepts the username, and password values from the user and checks the fields for proper validation. 
2. Create one user with admin/pass as login credentials validated through a database
3. The validated user gets redirected to a webpage where you show the cookie stored for the current session. Each new session should have its own cookie. 
4. Inform the user that the website collects cookies, and accept and store their consent in the database. Show cookie information on the webpage at the bottom that auto fades after 5 seconds 
5. If the user agrees, then display 5 Memes using the API ​ https://api.imgflip.com/​ (you can use any other API of your choice).
6. If the user denies then display sorry message and log them out
